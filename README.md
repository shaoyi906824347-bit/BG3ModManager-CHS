# BG3 Mod Manager 简体中文汉化版 / Simplified Chinese Localization

## 中文说明

这是 [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) 的简体中文汉化版，面向希望使用中文界面的《博德之门3》玩家。

本汉化版基于原始项目 1.0.12.9，保留原项目的主要功能和许可证，并额外修复了导出操作可能导致按钮永久变灰的问题。

从英文版迁移时，只需将原管理器目录中的 `Data` 和 `Orders` 文件夹复制到汉化版目录，即可保留设置、快捷键和模组排序。

请注意：汉化内容编译在程序文件中。不要使用程序内的“下载官方版更新”功能，否则官方英文版可能会覆盖汉化。请等待本仓库发布对应的汉化版更新。

## English Description

This is a community-maintained Simplified Chinese localization of [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), based on version 1.0.12.9 of the upstream project.

It keeps the original project's main features and license, and includes an additional fix for export operations that could leave the toolbar buttons disabled.

To migrate from the English version, copy the `Data` and `Orders` folders from the original manager directory to the Chinese version directory. This preserves settings, keybindings, and saved mod orders.

The localization is compiled into the program files. Do not use the in-app “Download Official Update” action, as it may replace the Chinese build with the official English version. Please wait for a matching Chinese release from this repository.

# LaughingLeader 的《博德之门 3》模组管理器 / Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager

A mod manager for [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/).

**This is the only official source for the BG3 Mod Manager.** There is no "official website" beyond this repository.

# Setup

1. Run the game once if you haven't already, so a profile and the mods folders get created.
2. Make sure you have [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.15-windows-x64-installer) and [the latest C++ redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.
3. [Grab the latest release.](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/latest/download/BG3ModManager_Latest.zip)
4. The BG3 Mod Manager is portable, so extract it to a non-protected folder (don't extract it to your Program Files).
5. Upon running `BG3ModManager.exe`, pathways to the game data and exe should be automatically detected.  
*If this fails, manually set the pathways in Settings -> Preferences, click 'Save', then click the 'Refresh' button so the campaign mod data is loaded.*  
![Preferences Window](/Screenshots/PreferencesWindow_GameDataPath.png?raw=true "Making sure the Game Data Path is set.")
6. Organize your active mods for the profile `Public`, then click the first export button (Export Load Order to Game), or click File -> Export Order to Game, to export your active load order to the game. This updates the `modsettings.lsx` file that the game reads.

# Important Tips  
* Make sure you don't have any subfolders in your mods folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`). This causes the game to reset your `modsettings.lsx`!
* Ensure the `Game Data Path` is set in Settings -> Preferences to the game's data folder, where all the various .pak files are (Gustav.pak etc).
* Make sure you have a campaign selected (i.e. "Main"). The game must have a campaign exported to the `modsettings.lsx`, or it will fail to load the main menu scene / have other issues.
* If your `modsettings.lsx` still resets when loading into the game, this means that one or more of your mods are encountering an error, and the game is clearing the load order.

# Current Features:

* Reorganize mod load orders with a quick drag-and-drop interface. Allows reordering multiple mods at once.
  * View details about each mod, including the description and dependencies.
* Save your mod load orders to external json files for sharing or backing things up.
* Export your active mod order to various text formats (i.e. a spreadsheet). These formats will include extra data, such as the mod's steam workshop url, if any.
* Filter mods by name and properties (author, mode, etc.).
* Export load order mods to zip files (including editor mods), for easier sharing of a playthrough's mods between friends.
* Import load orders from save files.
* Shortcut buttons to all the various game-related folders (mods folder, workshop folder, game directory, etc).
* Dark and light theme support.

## Features for Mod Authors

* Extract selected mods with a few clicks. Useful for mod authors, or those wanting to study mod files for learning.
* Copy a mod's UUID or FolderName in the right click menu. Useful for if you're setting up Ext.IsModLoaded checks with the script extender, for mod support.
* You can specify custom tags in your project's meta.lsx (the "Tags" property"). Seperate tags with a semi-colon, and the mod manager will display them.
* A "Version Generator" tool is available under the Tools menu, for generating the correct number for major/minor/revision/build numbers.

# Notes

* Mod projects in the Data folder are highlighted in green. They can be used in the load order like regular mods, and even exported to zip files.
* New profiles must be made in-game. You should also run the game at least once, so all of the game's user folders are created.
* Highlight over mods to see their description and list of dependencies. Red dependencies are missing dependencies.
